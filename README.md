# Market System

#### Update 21/02/2020:
Now database and all the tables required for the system is created automatically if you have the localhost connection opened.

Market System (Alışveriş sistemi), desktop application coded in Java, using JavaFX library and database to store information where various types of users can purchase and order different products from this application. The project consists of several modules. In the process of designing the project, it was decided to have 2 types of users: Moderators and Normal Users. Normal users have the ability to choose from various products with the benefit of searching or viewing them by their category, whereas Moderators have much more control over the program.

### Moderators can:
  * Add products to market
  * Remove products from market
  * Change the price of the products
  * Add sale to the products
  * Order the product (like normal users)

All the information about **users**, **products**, **baskets**, **orders** are stored on the database.

### Compile
To manually compile the program make sure to include javafx library into the project.

It is important to note that the content of the program is constructed in Turkish language.
